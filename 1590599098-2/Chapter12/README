copy the data/ directory to /tmp/ which is the expected, hard coded location 
(clearly not something we'd do in a real system!). The ApplicationController 
will look for /tmp/data/options.xml 

Note that you may need to create an sqlite database in /tmp/data (see 
transaction-script-setup.php for a rough and ready example for that)
