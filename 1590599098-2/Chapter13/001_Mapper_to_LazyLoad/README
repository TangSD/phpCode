copy the data/ directory to /tmp which is the expected, hard coded location 
(clearly not something we'd do in a real system!). The ApplicationController 
will look for /tmp/data/options.xml 

Some examples may also assume an sqlite database in /tmp/data -- see the 
build-db.php script for details.
